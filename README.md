# Iris
 It consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. For a reference, see the following papers: 
R. A. Fisher. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". Annals of Eugenics. 7 (2): 179â€“188, 1936. 
The goal is to construct a neural network that classifies each sample into the correct class, as well as applying validation and regularisation techniques.
